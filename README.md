# 📊 Data Analysis Project: Grocery Trends & Patient History Insights

## 🗂 Project Overview

This project presents two independent data analysis modules based on real-world datasets:

1. **BlinkIT Grocery Data** – A deep dive into online grocery product trends.
2. **Patient History Data** – Exploratory data analysis of medical records, patient conditions, and treatment insights.

Both datasets are analyzed using Python and Jupyter notebooks with appropriate data wrangling, visualization, and interpretation techniques.
